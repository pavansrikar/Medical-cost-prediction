# Medical-cost-prediction

ü©∫ Project Overview:
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate medical costs based on factors like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and transformed the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Converted categorical features (e.g., region, smoker status) into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
Feature Engineering:

Analyzed correlations between features and target variables.
Created interaction terms to improve model performance.
Modeling:

Experimented with multiple algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Fine-tuned the models using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to improve accuracy.
Evaluation:

Evaluated the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-Squared to assess prediction accuracy.
The Random Forest model provided the most accurate predictions with minimal error.
Interpretation & Insights:

Key Factors: Smoking and BMI were found to be significant factors driving up medical costs.
Prediction Accuracy: Achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting medical expenses, demonstrating the model's real-world applicability.
üí° Skills Gained:
Data Preprocessing: Developed expertise in cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Learned techniques to enhance model performance through feature creation and selection.
Machine Learning: Gained hands-on experience with regression algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: Strengthened my ability to evaluate model performance using different metrics.
Python Libraries: Utilized key Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
